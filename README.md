### Who am I? 🙋
🎓 On-going Master student on 🔧💉 Biomedical Engineering x 💻🧠 Information Science. I am standing at the edge of imaging modalities, 🔦🔊 the photoacoustics! Now you know what should be expected 😅 biology, signal processing, machine, and code. Hey! But I did bioinformatics before 🧬, some fancy codes with DNA.

Anyway, I am so eager with coding projects! You may find the repo 汚い coz I put things like a personal diary 😅.

### What you can find here? :
- 👀 Vision - most projects are about image analysis
- 🧬 Bioinformatics - there are some, probably obsolete projects I did during my Bachelor's
- 📓 Basic Data Science - at some point, dealing with a table can be refreshing!
